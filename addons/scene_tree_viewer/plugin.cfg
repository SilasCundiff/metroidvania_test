name="Scene Tree Inspector"
description="A small plugin I use to wrangle my scenes and nodes in one easily sortable list. Presents all of your nodes and scenes in a traditional file browser type tree.

Single click to open a scene in your inspector.
Double click to open the scene or script (depending on which tab you have opened and if the node has a script attached to it or not) 
If a scene or script is already open, it will instead attempt to focus that item instead."
